# Titanic Survival Prediction

Predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning.

## Overview

This project explores the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on features such as age, gender, class, and more. The analysis and modeling are performed in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Features

- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering to improve model performance
- Training various machine learning models
- Evaluation and comparison of model accuracy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see below)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhay-0-r/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the main notebook and follow the steps.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset is available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset).

- `train.csv` - Training data used for model building
- `test.csv` - Test data for making predictions

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter Notebook in the 'notebooks' folder.
- Follow the steps for data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- You can modify or extend the notebook to try new models or feature engineering strategies.

## Results

The notebook includes metrics and visualizations to help you understand the model's performance and the importance of different features.
